# Introduction
ActivityLog is a general mobile phone application that helps urban climate researchers and social scientists study spatio-temporal dynamics of human interaction with urban environment. Data collected through ActivityLog are timestamped, geo-referenced, and easily paired up with air temperature and relative humidity sensors such as Kestrel Drop (a portable Bluetooth enabled environmental data logger). Specifically, ActivityLog - HeatMappers is designed to support the development of HeatMappers citizen science project, which utilizes to understand the heat vulnerable population in Maricopa County, Arizona. 

ActivityLog - HeatMappers has five main functionalities. First, it notifies users from 8am to 8pm at every two hours interval to remind about activity logging. Secondly, it periodically collects users’ locations at a certain pre-defined time interval. Thirdly, it can be paired with a portable Kestrel Drop device to inform users about current temperature, relative humidity and heat stress index. Fourthly, the mobile application contains a link to HeatMappers online survey from Qualtric platform. Lastly, all collected data (location, time, temperature, relative humidity, heat stress index, human activity) are synced with a cloud database that can help researchers monitor data collection progress in a real-time manner and reduce data cleaning efforts.
